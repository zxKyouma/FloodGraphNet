## Environment Setup

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml

```

## Dataset
Download the [UrbanFloodBench dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18XT8NlOfWOnR64mi6faKOR2mVzqpaLSA/view) and the [model checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1BIUuIi7HLhT46s47kIhYu0hA4vBXFsmG)

After downloading:
1. Extract the archive
2. Place the extracted folders in the project root (`./`) 
3. Run the metadata setup script:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/populate_model_metadata.sh
   ```
4. Place the model checkpoints in `/saved_models`

## Approach

We use a **graph-aware stacked XGBoost pipeline** rather than a single end-to-end sequence model.

Flood behavior in this task is **not purely local**: each node depends on *upstream inflow*, *downstream blockage*, *storage*, and *boundary conditions*. A single flat regressor struggled to represent these different hydraulic regimes.

By combining **graph-derived features**, **physics-inspired hydraulic proxy features**, **auxiliary flow surrogates (`qnet`, `qin`, `qout`)**, and a **two-stage regime-aware predictor**, the model captures propagation, retention, and delayed drainage more reliably than local rainfall and water-level features alone.

---

### Model Overview

At a high level, the model works in **four stages**.

**Stage 1 — Graph-aware feature construction**

> We build node-level temporal features from rainfall, water level, and static network attributes, then augment them with **graph features**, **boundary indicators**, and **mass-deficit storage proxies** that encode coarse hydraulic structure.

**Stage 2 — Auxiliary flow prediction**

> We train **Stage-A models** to predict latent hydraulic quantities such as **net flow**, **inflow**, and **outflow**. Their **out-of-fold predictions** are fed back into the feature set.

**Stage 3 — Regime-aware prediction**

> A **two-stage XGBoost predictor** combines **regime classification** with **conditional regression**, allowing the model to treat calm, rising, and storage-dominated states differently.

**Stage 4 — Final submission assembly**

> The full pipeline is trained separately for **`Model_1`** and **`Model_2`**, and their predictions are merged into the final submission.

### Preprocessing
- **Normalization:** z-score normalization applied to all static and dynamic node/edge features.

- **Stabilization of heavy-tailed features:**
  - Clipping of extreme values
  - `log1p` / `asinh` transforms for hydraulic ratios and interaction terms

- **Edge-case handling:**
  - Dedicated treatment of zero-area endpoint nodes to maintain stable feature distributions

---

### Hyperparameters

All hyperparameters were tuned using **Optuna**.

- **Main regressor:** 800 trees, learning rate 0.03, max depth 8  
- **Regime classifier:** 600 trees, learning rate 0.03, max depth 6  
- **Event settings:** quantile = 0.88, horizon = 24

### Feature Engineering

The final model used a total of 262 features.

The strongest feature families in the final submission were:

#### 1. Graph-propagated water-level context

> These features summarize nearby hydraulic state over the drainage graph rather than using only the local node.

- **`fe_graph_pulse`**
- **`fe_graph_hop2_features`**
- **`fe_level_imbalance_features`**

#### 2. Stage-A net-flow stack (`qnet`)

> We train an auxiliary model to predict net flow, then feed those predictions back into the main model.

- **`qnet_stack`**
- **`qnet_phys_baseline_feature`**
- **`fe_qhat_graph2`**
- **`fe_qhat_graph2_hop2`**

#### 3. Stage-A inflow / outflow stack (`qin`, `qout`)

> These features expose directional transport structure that is hard to recover from local predictors alone.

- **`qinout_stack`**

#### 4. Basin mass-deficit and storage proxy features

> These are the main mass-balance-like engineered features.

- **`fe_basin_mass_deficit_features`**

A detailed list of all included features is included in `FEATURES.md`.
